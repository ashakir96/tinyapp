# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). This was built for a project at Lighthouse labs. This app requires a user to register/login in order to create tiny urls for longer ones to share with their friends.
